      "content": "When starting a permaculture project one will eventually be faced with the need to propagate plants. If the project is large, this means many plants will have to be grown either from seeds or from cuttings. Often, the practical approach to the problem will be to start the plants in pots.\n\nIn this article(http://permaculturenews.org/2013/11/25/introduction-naturalised-nursery-practice/) Jye Dawes talks about his natural approach to growing plants in a nursery setting and shares his thoughts about creating a healthy growth medium for plants.\n",
