EdibleForestGarden.ca is dedicated to offering inspiring and practical information
on the vision, ecology, design, and stewardship of perennial polycultures of
multipurpose plants in small-scale or large-scale settings. We intend this website
to grow into an information and networking resource for newcomers, amateurs, students,
and serious practitioners and researchers alike.

Forest gardening is an idea whose time has come. We can consciously apply the principles
of ecology to the design of gardens that mimic forest ecosystem structure and function,
but grow food, fuel, fiber, fodder, fertilizer, medicinals and fun. Indeed, we must
begin learning to apply ecological principles to the design of our food production
systems now as we have surpassed the peak of planetary oil production, so the world of
energy descent lies upon us. This sea change in our culture will require that we learn
to live within our energetic means and rebuild ecosystems that support human and humane
lives without diminishing the ability of the ecosystem to support our children and
grandchildren.

While this global problem is huge, most of the solutions available to us are local,
personal, empowering, and potentially enlivening, enlightening, and fun. Edible forest
gardening is one of these solutions, and we now have the resources at hand to transform
our own yards and gardens into productive paradises.

We intend this website to give you the most sophisticated and down-to-earth information
available to maximize your success as a forest gardener.

Forest gardens have much to offer on a practical level, and they have much to teach us
about how to live in community as free and interdependent beings in a functional way.
We hope that you will trust your innate ability to learn and contribute to the larger
community of human beings who care about living sanely and humanely as we journey through
energy descent.

We hope you enjoy what we offer here, and that you will visit often to add your thoughts
and experiences to the mix.
