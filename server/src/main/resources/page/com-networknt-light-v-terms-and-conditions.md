### ACCOUNT ELIGIBILITY

1. By registering for or using the Services, you represent and warrant that:

### TRANSFERS

We may assist you with the transfer of your website to our platform for an additional fee. Please contact a member of our Transfers department to receive a price quote. However, in some cases we may not be able to transfer your data from an old host. Each hosting company is configured differently, and some hosting platforms save data in an incompatible or proprietary format, which may make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to migrate some or all account data. We do not make any guarantees regarding the availability, possibility, or time required to complete an account transfer. In no event shall NetworkNT be held liable for any lost or missing data or files resulting from a transfer to or from NetworkNT. You are solely responsible for backing up your data in all circumstances.

### PROHIBITED PERSONS (COUNTRIES, ENTITIES, AND INDIVIDUALS)

The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), prohibits companies from engaging in all or certain commercial activities with certain sanctioned countries or regions (each a “Sanctioned Country/Region”) and certain individuals, organizations or entities, including without limitation, certain “Specially Designated Nationals” (“SDN”) listed by OFAC. If you are located in a Sanctioned Country/Region or are listed as an SDN, you are prohibited from registering or signing up with, subscribing to, or using the Services. Unless otherwise provided with explicit permission, NetworkNT also does not register, and prohibits the use of any of our Services in connection with, any Country-Code Top Level Domain Name (“ccTLD”) for any Sanctioned Country/Region.

### ACCOUNT SECURITY AND NETWORKNT SYSTEMS

1. It is your responsibility to ensure that scripts/programs installed under your account are secure and permissions of directories are set properly, regardless of the installation method. When at all possible, set permissions on most directories to 755 or as restrictive as possible. You are ultimately responsible for all actions taken under your account. This includes the compromise of credentials such as user name and password. You are required to use a secure password. If a weak password is used, your account may be suspended until you agree to use a more secure password. Audits may be done to prevent weak passwords from being used. If an audit is performed, and your password is found to be weak, we will notify you and allow time for you to change or update your password before suspending your account.

2. The Services, including all related equipment, networks and network devices are provided only for authorized customer use. NetworkNT may, but is not obligated to, monitor our systems, including without limitation, to ensure that use is authorized, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied and used for authorized purposes. By using the Services, you consent to monitoring for these purposes.

3. Any account found connecting to a third party network or system without authorization from the third party is subject to suspension. Access to networks or systems outside of your direct control requires the express written consent of the third party. NetworkNT may, at our discretion, request documentation to prove that your access to a third party network or system is authorized.

4. Any account which causes us to receive an abuse report may be terminated and/or have access to services suspended. If you do not remove malicious content from your account after being notified by NetworkNT of an issue, we reserve the right to leave access to services disabled.

5. NetworkNT reserves the right to migrate your account from one data center to another in order to comply with applicable data center policies, local law or for technical or other reasons without notice.

### HIPAA DISCLAIMER

NetworkNT’s services do not comply with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).

You are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws governing the privacy and security of personal data, including medical or other sensitive data. You acknowledge that the Services are not appropriate for the storage or control of access to sensitive data, such as information about children or medical or health information. NetworkNT does not control or monitor the information or data you store on, or transmit through, our Services. We specifically disclaim any representation or warranty that the Services, as offered, comply with HIPAA. Customers requiring secure storage of “Protected Health Information” as defined under HIPAA are expressly prohibited from using this Service for such purposes. Storing and permitting access to “protected health information,” is a material violation of this Agreement, and grounds for immediate account termination. NetworkNT does not sign “Business Associate Agreements” and you agree that NetworkNT is not a Business Associate or subcontractor or agent of yours pursuant to HIPAA. If you have questions about the security of your data, contact us at support@networknt.com.

### COMPATIBILITY WITH THE SERVICES

It is solely your responsibility to provide any equipment or software that may be necessary for your use of the Services. To the extent that the performance of any of our obligations under this Agreement may depend upon your performance of your obligations, NetworkNT is not responsible for any delays due to your failure to timely perform your obligations.

2. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all User Content and User Websites are compatible with the hardware and software used by NetworkNT to provide the Services, which may be changed by NetworkNT from time to time in our sole discretion.

3. You are solely responsible for backing-up all User Content, including but not limited to, any User Websites. NetworkNT does not warrant that we back-up any User Content, and you agree to accept the risk of loss of any and all User Content.

### BILLING AND PAYMENT INFORMATION

1. Prepayment.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your payment information is up to date, and that all invoices are paid on time. You agree to pay for the Services in advance of the time period during which such Services are provided. Subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations, payments received will be first applied to the oldest outstanding invoice in your billing account.

2. Autorenewal.

Unless otherwise provided, you agree that until and unless you notify NetworkNT of your desire to cancel the Services, you will be billed on an automatically recurring basis to prevent any disruption to your Services, using your credit card or other billing information on file with us or our payment service providers.

3. Taxes.

Listed fees for the Services do not include any applicable sales, use, revenue, excise or other taxes imposed by any taxing authority. Any applicable taxes will be added to NetworkNT's invoice as a separate charge to be paid by you. All fees are non-refundable when paid unless otherwise stated.

4. Late Payment.

All invoices must be paid within fifteen (15) days of the invoice due date. Any invoice that is outstanding for more than fifteen (15) days may result in the suspension or termination of Services. Access to the account will not be restored until payment has been received. If you fail to pay the fees as specified herein, NetworkNT may suspend or terminate your account and pursue the collection costs incurred by NetworkNT, including without limitation, any arbitration and legal fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees. NetworkNT will not activate new orders or activate new packages for customers who have an outstanding balance on their account.

5. Domain Payments.

It is solely your responsibility to notify NetworkNT’s Billing department by email to support@networknt.com after purchasing a domain. Domain renewal notices are provided as a courtesy reminder and NetworkNT is not responsible for a failure to renew a domain or a failure to notify a customer about a domain's renewal. Domain renewals are billed and renewed fifteen (15) days before the renew date.

6. Fraud.

It is a violation of this Agreement for you to misuse or fraudulently use credit cards, charge cards, electronic funds transfers, electronic checks, or any other payment method. NetworkNT may report any such misuse or fraudulent use, as determined in NetworkNT’s sole discretion, to governmental and law enforcement authorities, credit reporting services, financial institutions and/or credit card companies.

7. Invoice Disputes.

You have ninety (90) days to dispute any charge or payment processed by NetworkNT. If you have any questions concerning a charge on your account, please reach out to our billing department for assistance.

### CANCELLATIONS AND REFUNDS

1. Payment Method.

No refunds will be provided if you use any of the following methods of payment: bank wire transfers, Western Union payments, checks and money orders. If you use any of these payment methods, any applicable credit will be posted to your hosting account instead of a refund.

2. Money-back Guarantee.

NetworkNT offers a forty-five (45) day money- back guarantee for NetworkNT's managed shared hosting services only. If you purchase an account with a forty-five (45) day money-back guarantee and then cancel within the first forty-five (45) days of the beginning of the initial term (the “Money-Back Guarantee Period”), you will, upon your written request to the NetworkNT Support Team (the “Refund Request”) within ninety (90) days of such termination or cancellation (“Notice Period”), receive a full refund of all basic shared hosting fees previously paid by you to NetworkNT for the initial term (“Money-Back Guarantee Refund”); provided that such Money-Back Guarantee Refund shall be due to you only upon your compliance with, and subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of, this Section 12. Requests for these refunds must be made in writing to the NetworkNT Support Team. Refunds will only be issued for basic shared hosting services and will not include administrative fees, install fees for custom software or other setup fees, nor will they include any fees for any other additional services. Money Back Guarantee Refunds will not accrue, and shall not be paid under any circumstances, if you do not provide the applicable Refund Request within the Notice Period.

3. Refund Eligibility.

Only first-time accounts are eligible for a refund. For example, if you've had an account with us before, canceled and signed up again, or if you have opened a second account with us, you will not be eligible for a refund. There are no refunds on administrative fees and install fees for custom software. Violations of this Agreement will waive your rights under the refund policy.

4. Non-refundable Products and Services.

Domain refunds will only be considered if the domain was ordered in conjunction with a hosting package and will be issued at NetworkNT’s sole discretion. Any refunds issued for domain names will be reduced by the market value of the gTLD. Purchases of ccTLDs are non-refundable.

5. Cancellation Process.

You may terminate or cancel the Services by giving NetworkNT written notice via the cancellation form provided. In such event: (i) you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such cancellation and (ii) NetworkNT may, in our sole discretion, refund all pre-paid fees for basic hosting services for the full months remaining after the effectiveness of such cancellation (i.e. no partial month fees shall be refunded) less any setup fees, applicable taxes and any discount applied for prepayment, provided that you are not in breach of this Agreement.

Once we receive your cancellation form and have confirmed all necessary information with you via email, we will inform you in writing (typically email) that your account has been canceled. Your cancellation confirmation will contain a ticket/tracking number in the subject line for your reference and for verification purposes. You should immediately receive an automatic email with a tracking number stating that "Your request has been received...." NetworkNT will confirm your request and process your cancellation shortly thereafter. If you do not hear back from us, or do not receive the automatic confirmation email within a few minutes after submitting your cancellation form, please contact us immediately via support@networknt.com. We require all cancellations to be done through the online form in order to (a) confirm your identity, (b) confirm in writing that you are prepared for all of your files and emails to be removed, and (c) document the request. This process aims to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, fraudulent/malicious requests, and to ensure that you are aware that your files, emails, and account may be removed immediately and permanently after a cancellation request is processed. Cancellations for shared accounts will be effective on the account’s renewal date.

6. Domains.

Domain renewals are billed and renewed fifteen (15) days before the renewal date. It is your responsibility to notify NetworkNT’s Billing department via email support@networknt.com to cancel any domain registration at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date. No refunds will be given once a domain is renewed. All domain registrations and renewals are final.

7. Foreign Currencies.

Exchange rate fluctuations for international payments are constant and unavoidable. All refunds are processed in U.S. dollars and will reflect the exchange rate in effect on the date of the refund. All refunds are subject to this fluctuation and NetworkNT is not responsible for any change in exchange rates between the time of payment and the time of refund.

8 Termination

NetworkNT may terminate your access to the Services, in whole or in part, without notice in the event that: (i) you fail to pay any fees due; (ii) you violate this Agreement; (iii) your conduct may harm NetworkNT or others or cause NetworkNT or others to incur liability, as determined by NetworkNT in our sole discretion; or (iv) as otherwise specified in this Agreement. In such event, NetworkNT shall not refund to you any fees paid in advance of such termination, and you shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such termination. Additionally, NetworkNT may charge you for all fees due for the Services for the remaining portion of the then current term.

UPON TERMINATION OF THE SERVICES FOR ANY REASON, USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES, AND OTHER DATA WILL BE DELETED.

### CPU, BANDWIDTH AND DISK USAGE

All use of hosting space provided by NetworkNT is subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy.

Shared accounts may not be used to resell web hosting to others. Shared hosting space may only be used for web files, active email and content of User Websites. Shared hosting space may not be used for storage (whether of media, emails, or other data), including, as offsite storage of electronic files, email or FTP hosts. NetworkNT expressly reserves the right to review every shared account for excessive usage of CPU, disk space and other resources that may be caused by a violation of this Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policy. NetworkNT may, in our sole discretion, terminate access to the Services, apply additional fees, or remove or delete User Content for those accounts that are found to be in violation of NetworkNT’s terms and conditions. Shared servers are not limited in their bandwidth allowance.

### UPTIME GUARANTEE

If your shared server has a physical downtime that falls short of the 99.9% uptime guarantee, you may receive one (1) month of credit on your account. This uptime guarantee does not apply to planned maintenance. Approval of any credit is at the sole discretion of NetworkNT and may be dependent upon the justification provided. Third party monitoring service reports may not be used for justification due to a variety of factors including the monitor's network capacity/transit availability. The uptime of the server is defined as the reported uptime from the operating system and the web server which may differ from the uptime reported by other individual services. To request a credit, please send an email to support@networknt.com with justification within thirty (30) days of the end of the month for which you are requesting a credit.

### PRICE CHANGE

NetworkNT reserves the right to change prices, the monthly payment amount, or any other charges at any time. We will provide you with at least thirty (30) days’ notice before charging you with any price change. It is your sole responsibility to periodically review billing information provided by NetworkNT through the user billing tool or through other methods of communication, including notices sent or posted by NetworkNT .

### COUPONS

Discounts and coupon codes are reserved for first-time accounts or first-time customers only and may not be used towards the purchase of a domain registration unless otherwise specified. If you have previously signed up using a particular domain, you may not sign up again for that domain using another coupon at a later date. Any account found in violation of these policies will be reviewed by our Sales department and the appropriate charges will be added to the account. Coupon abuse will not be tolerated and may result in the suspension or termination of your account. All coupons and discounts are only valid towards the initial purchase and do not affect the renewal or recurring price.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

IN NO EVENT WILL NETWORKNT ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY USER CONTENT, USER WEBSITES OR OTHER MATERIALS ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED THROUGH THE SERVICES, EVEN IF NETWORKNT IS AWARE OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NETWORKNT'S LIABILITY TO YOU, OR ANY PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU, FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO NETWORKNT FOR THE SERVICES IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL ACTION GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY. THIS IS AN AGGREGATE LIMIT. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM HEREUNDER WILL NOT INCREASE THIS LIMIT.

### INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless NetworkNT, our affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (each an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, suits, actions, demands, proceedings (whether legal or administrative), and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's fees) threatened, asserted, or filed by a third party against any of the Indemnified Parties arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the Services, (ii) any breach or violation by you of this Agreement; or (iii) any acts or omissions by you. The terms of this section shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

### ARBITRATION

By using the Services, you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of this Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator chosen by NetworkNT and will be held at the AAA location chosen by NetworkNT in Texas. Payment of all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph. In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NetworkNT will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not any state arbitration law, governs all arbitration under this paragraph. All decisions rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final. The arbitrator's award is final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator’s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and NetworkNT alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. If you initiate litigation or any other proceeding against NetworkNT in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay NetworkNT’s reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with our enforcement of this paragraph.

### INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

NetworkNT and User are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement places NetworkNT and User in the relationship of principal and agent, partners or joint venturers. Neither party has, expressly or by implication, or may represent itself as having, any authority to make contracts or enter into any agreements in the name of the other party, or to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

### GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the formation of this Agreement or the breach of this Agreement, including any claim based upon an alleged tort, shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of Texas. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

### DISCLAIMER

NetworkNT shall not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. NetworkNT makes no warranties of any kind, expressed or implied for the Services. NetworkNT disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, including loss of data resulting from delays, delivery failures, wrong deliveries, and any and all service interruptions caused by NetworkNT or our employees.

### BACKUPS AND DATA LOSS

Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. NetworkNT’s backup service runs once a week and overwrites any of our previous backups. Only one week of backups are kept at a time. This service is only provided as a courtesy and may be modified or terminated at any time at NetworkNT’s sole discretion. NetworkNT is not responsible for files and/or data residing on your account. You agree to take full responsibility for all files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on NetworkNT’s servers.

Any shared account using more than 20 gigs of disk space will be removed from our off site weekly backup with the exception of databases continuing to be backed up. All data will continue to be mirrored to a secondary drive to help protect against data loss in the event of a drive failure.

NETWORKNT AND OUR AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES (I) THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR COMPLETELY SECURE; (II) AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (III) AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR CONTENT OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES. NETWORKNT AND OUR AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS ARE NOT LIABLE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY, FOR THE CONTENT OF ANY DATA TRANSFERRED EITHER TO OR FROM USERS OR STORED BY USERS ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES. THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

### DISCLOSURE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

### FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party is liable for any default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than failure to make payments when due) if such default or delay is caused, directly or indirectly, by forces beyond such party's reasonable control, including, without limitation, fire, flood, acts of God, labor disputes, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, interruptions of transportation or communications, supply shortages or the failure of any third party to perform any commitment relative to the production or delivery of any equipment or material required for such party to perform its obligations hereunder.

### THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement is intended, nor shall anything herein be construed to confer any rights in any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, user acknowledges and agrees that any supplier of a third-party product or service that is identified as a third-party beneficiary in the service description, is an intended third-party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in this Agreement as they relate specifically to its products or services and shall have the right to enforce directly the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to its products or services against user as if it were a party to this Agreement.
