            <h1>Development Environment</h1>
            <p>
                I personally use Linux as my dev environment and I would recommend you do so; however, Mac and Windows are perfectly OK.
                The following steps are for Ubuntu Linux and some of the commands might be different on Other Linux distributions, Mac and Windows. My production is CentOS 6.5 32bit and the installation guide is <a href="/page/production_single">here</a>

                I also recommend Google Chrome as your browser for Front End AngularJS testing and debugging.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Linux, the dev environment will mimic production environment so it is easier to deploy your site to Linux based production. Also, you can learn a lot about security once your site is public.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Create a user for development: (If you have a user already on the Linux box other than root, please use it) The following assumes that you logged in as root.
                <pre>
            #adduser steve

            #visudo
            This is to edit /etc/sudoers to add steve to the last line so that he can use sudo command
            Never use vi to edit the above file!

            Add steve right after
            root ALL=(ALL)   ALL
            with
            steve ALL=(ALL)   ALL

            vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

            change the following line
            #PermitRootLogin  yes
            to
            PermitRootLogin no

            change the following line
            #UserDNS yes
            to
            UserDNS  no

            Log out from root and log in with steve. From this moment on, please use sudo command instead of logging in as root.
                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Install JDK8, maven, node.js and npm with sudo and then using npm to install Grunt, Gulp, Bower and other modules.

                

            </p>
            <p>
                3. Create dev folder and check out the source code.
                <pre>
            log in to the user you just created.
            $mkdir networknt
            $cd networknt

            Check out Json Token which is forked from Google and fixed some of the issues.
            $git clone https://github.com/networknt/jsontoken.git
            Check out light rule engine which is a Java based rule engine used in the back end
            $git clone https://github.com/networknt/rule-engine.git
            Check out the light framework and other projects
            $git clone https://github.com/networknt/light.git

            $cd jsontoken
            $mvn clean install
            $cd ..
            $cd rule-engine
            $mvn clean install
            $cd rule-loader
            $mvn clean install
            $cd ~
            $cd light
            $mvn clean install -DskipTests

            Now you have all the Java code built already.

                </pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Open the source code with your IDE. I am using JetBrains Idea but other IDE like Eclipse will work. From Idea, you can just select File/Open... and then choose ~/networknt/light folder to open. It will import the pom.xml file under the light folder. You might need to select JDK for java projects if Idea couldn't find the JDK.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Set up other users and virtual host. Light Framework supports multiple web sites hosted on the same IP address. In the ~/networknt/light folder there are three sites included.
                <ul>networknt folder contains source code for www.networknt.com which is the main site for Light Framework</ul>
                <ul>edibleforestgarden folder contains source code for www.edibleforestgarden.ca which is a socail commerce site to demo the features of the framework</ul>
                <ul>example folder is a template site that can be copied to start your own web site.</ul>
                Let's create three users for each site and if you are building a new site, create one extra user for it.
                <pre>
            sudo adduser networknt
            sudo adduser edibleforestgarden
            sudo adduser example
                </pre>

                Copy and update server.json and virtualhost.json to /home directory and update them if necessary.
                <pre>
            sudo cp ~/networknt/light/server.json /home
            sudo cp ~/networknt/light/virtualhost.json /home
                </pre>

            </p>

            <p>
                6. Start server from IDE in debug mode. From your IDE, right click server/src/main/java/com/networknt/light/server/LightServer and select Debug. The first time the server is started it will create the database and replay the event in resources/initdb.json. It will take several minutes until the debug info is stopped. At this time, you can start Grunt webserver to monitor all your changes in the local directory.
                <pre>
        cd ~/networknt/light/networknt
        npm install
        bower install
        grunt serve
                </pre>
                assuming that Chrome is your default browser, it will be started now and point to localhost:9000 with www.networknt.com site content. I am in a process to move everything from Grunt to Gulp but it is not been done yet.

            </p>
            <p>
                For individual component/view/application development, you can go the the folder and run the following commands to start another webserver using gulp
        <pre>
        cd ~/networknt/light/view/com-networknt-light-v-example
        npm install
        bower install
        gulp webserver
        </pre>
               Now another server is up listening localhost:8001 using gulp webserver. You can switch to other folders to do the same.

            </p>
